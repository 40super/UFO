# UFO

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis to have a site that has data on UFO sightning across the globe. Furthermore, the data can be filtered to fit the needs of anyone looking for a particular sighting.

## Results
Dana can now use this sight to filter to certain points in time and filter even more by shape of the UFO, and even the location. For example, let's say Dana wants to look for a particular date first we can input that and it will filter the table.

!["DATE"](static/images/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-02%20at%202.09.07%20PM.png)

Once Dana does that she can then look at what cities she interested in that had sighting at that time.

!["CITY"](static/images/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-02%20at%202.09.18%20PM.png)

Once the city is chosen the table is more smaller which help Dana pinpoint what information she needs.

!["SHAPE"](static/images/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-02%20at%202.09.32%20PM.png)

The final filter Dana can use is the shape which resulted in two entries that fit all the information she needed.

## Summary

One drawback that I can see with this website is how the information is presented. By providing a link or way to get more information from filtered data can help people get more information that they need. The table provide ample amount of information that gives a general idea but as a UFO sighting website, there should be more information.

One reccomendation that I think would be beneficial to this site is providing a map with pins of all the locations of UFO sighting which provides more visual information of where these UFO sighting are often seen. Another reccomendation I would recommend is to provide links to sources of where these UFO sighting are presented to enhance credibility.
